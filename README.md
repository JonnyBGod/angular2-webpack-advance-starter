## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular2-webpack-starter/
 ├──config/                    * our configuration
 |   ├──helpers.js             * helper functions for our configuration files

```

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.x.x`+ (or `v5.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typings` (`npm install --global typings`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install typings webpack-dev-server rimraf webpack -g` to install required global dependencies
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `typings install` to install necessary typings
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod
```

### hot module replacement
```bash
npm run server:dev:hmr
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### watch and run our tests
```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have your server running in another terminal
npm run e2e
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:update
npm run webdriver:start
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:start
# in another terminal
npm run e2e:live
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application

# Contributing
You can include more examples as components but they must introduce a new concept such as `Home` component (separate folders), and Todo (services). I'll accept pretty much everything so feel free to open a Pull-Request

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.7.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

# Typings
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you need to include external Type Definitions with Typings

## Use latest Typings module
```
npm install --global typings
```

## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with typings

```
typings install dt~node --save --global
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```


If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
declare var _: any;
declare var $: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```

You can include your type definitions in this file until you create one for the typings registry
see [typings/registry](https://github.com/typings/registry)

# Frequently asked questions
* What's the current browser support for Angular 2 Beta?
  * Please view the updated list of [browser support for Angular 2](https://github.com/angularclass/awesome-angular2#current-browser-support-for-angular-2)
* Why is my service, aka provider, is not injecting parameter correctly?
  * Please use `@Injectable()` for your service for typescript to correctly attach the metadata (this is a TypeScript problem)
* How do I run protractor with node 0.12.x?
  * please check out this repo to use the old version of protractor [#146](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/146/files)
* Where do I write my tests?
  * You can write your tests next to your component files. See [`/src/app/home/home.spec.ts`](/src/app/home/home.spec.ts)
* How do I start the app when I get `EACCES` and `EADDRINUSE` errors?
  * The `EADDRINUSE` error means the port `3000` is currently being used and `EACCES` is lack of permission for webpack to build files to `./dist/`
* How to use `sass` for css?
 * `loaders: ['raw-loader','sass-loader']` and `@Component({ styles: [ require('./filename.scss') ] })` see issue [#136](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/136)
* How do I test a Service?
 * See issue [#130](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/130#issuecomment-158872648)
* How do I add `vscode-chrome-debug` support?
 * The VS Code chrome debug extension support can be done via `launch.json` see issue [#144](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/144#issuecomment-164063790)
* How do I make the repo work in a virtual machine?
 * You need to use `0.0.0.0` so revert these changes [#205](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/205/files)
* What are the naming conventions for Angular 2?
 * please see issue [#185](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/185) and PR [196](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/196)
* How do I include bootstrap or jQuery?
 * please see issue [#215](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/215) and [#214](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/214#event-511768416)
* I'm getting an error about not finding my module that I installed?
 * please see [How to include or create custom type definitions](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-or-create-custom-type-definitions) and [custom-typings.d.ts](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/src/custom-typings.d.ts)
* How do I async load a component?
 * see wiki [How-do-I-async-load-a-component-with-AsyncRoute](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-do-I-async-load-a-component-with-AsyncRoute)

 * Remove `node_modules/` and run `npm cache clean` then `npm install`
* What about Webpack 2?
 * If you're looking for Webpack 2 version then see the [experimental version](https://github.com/gdi2290/angular2-webpack2-starter) that will be merged soon.
* How do I turn on Hot Module Replacement
 * Run `npm run server:dev:hmr`
* `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`
 * This is a problem with minifying Angular 2 and it's recent JIT templates. If you set `mangle` to `false` then you should be good.
* Why is the size of my app larger in development?
 * We are using inline source-maps and hot module replacement which will increase the bundle size.
* If you're in China
 * check out https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm
* If you're looking to add Angular 2 Material Design
 * check out the [material2](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/material2) branch
* node-pre-gyp ERR in npm install (Windows)
 * install Python x86 version between 2.5 and 3.0 on windows see issue [#626](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/626)
